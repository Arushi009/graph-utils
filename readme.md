## Specific utilities for Graph (Personalized STLs)

This repo contains utilites for various graph functions which are used quite often while working with problems of graphs.

Some of them are as follows:

1. Creation of adjacency list from the egdes of a directed or undirected graph
2. Checking whether a graph contains a cycle or not
3. Finding the shortest path starting from a particular node
4. Finding the breadth and depth first traversals of a graph

We just have to define the pre-processor directives in our working file and we'll be able to implement the above mentioned utilies by just invoking them.
